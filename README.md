Sourcecode for the GitHub App [slash-rebase](https://github.com/apps/slash-rebase)

```
npm run install
npm run dev
```

You can run this wherever. The code is repo agnostic. But you'll need a github user and token to actually perform the rebase.

Set the following env vars

```
GITHUB_USER
GITHUB_PASSWORD
```

Docker support coming soon.
